In the 16th a final week of the project we made some adjustments to the user interface, while also testing the device in more realistic environments. For the most part, it is working as desired. We are capable of localizing our microphone outdoors, acquiring sound signals, sending and receiving the data via LoRa and presenting a power spectrum corresponding to that signal, while also indicating, in a map, the location where the sampling took place.

We also prepared the necessary files for the final deliver, namely a video explaining our project, a pitch deck and a poster to present on the Demo Day.

During this process, we encountered some issues with our product. Even though they are not impeditive for presentation matters (specially if we take advanatge of videos), they should be fixed. Such problems affect both hardware and software components: sometimes, the GPS is rather unpredictable, in the sense that it can give us either the correct location or an old locaition that it has not removed from its buffer or even none at all; regarding the interface, the zoom of the map is currently a default value, while it should be user-defined, to guarantee a better visualization of the points in the map.
