This week, our Smart Sound Monitoring project witnessed significant developments as we navigated through crucial decisions and operational adjustments. Building upon the insights gained from our previous efforts, we strategically refined our approach to ensure efficiency and efficacy in our pursuit of accurate sound monitoring.

Our journey began with a visit to IStartLab, where we engaged in in-depth discussions regarding the feasibility of indoor positioning. After careful deliberation, we collectively concluded that indoor positioning was not a viable option due to inherent limitations. Consequently, we made the strategic decision to transition towards outdoor positioning, leveraging GPS technology for precise location tracking. This shift not only promises enhanced accuracy but also expands the scope of potential applications for our solution.

With our strategic direction established, we proceeded to allocate tasks among team members, ensuring that each aspect of the project received dedicated attention. From battery management and LoRa integration to interface development and GPS implementation, every component was meticulously addressed to ensure seamless integration and functionality.

A significant milestone achieved this week was the successful implementation of GPS position fixing with Arduino. This accomplishment represents a critical step forward in our quest for accurate outdoor monitoring capabilities, laying the groundwork for future advancements.

Simultaneously, progress was made on the interface front, with the system now capable of receiving coordinates and intensity values. This advancement paves the way for comprehensive data visualization and analysis, enhancing the usability and utility of our solution.

Reflecting on our progress, it is evident that each challenge we encounter serves as an opportunity for learning and refinement. By embracing adaptability and strategic decision-making, we remain committed to advancing the capabilities of smart sound monitoring technology.
