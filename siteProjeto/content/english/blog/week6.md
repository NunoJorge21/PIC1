In the 3rd meeting with our project assistent, we confirmed the necessary features for the intermediate delivery, namely the acquisition of pure sinusoids and its representation in both time and frequency domains.

We also discussed with our partners at XLR the possibility of integrating our system with the d&b ArrayCalc software. We decided to get in touch with other companies first, since d&b tends to be less open to external proposals. 

> Some of the other companies to consider are the developers of the RiTA software and the NEXT Audiogroup.
