The team spent the last weeks improving the prototype.

In the Graphical User Interface, other functionalities were implemented, namely, the possibility to remove data points in the map and a button to readjust the map view to a default zoom and center (which is useful in case the users lose track of their location in the map). The issue we were facing regarding the nonstop periodic automatic updating of the web page is now dealt with; the users are responsible for manually updating the data presented on the map (when available).

The physical device has also been equipped with new features: there is a switch to turn it on/off; a solar panel charges it when sunlight is available; the replacement of the old electronics a printed circuit board made it much more compact; the new antena responsible for the communications via LoRa allows information to be properly transmitted over a much greater distance.

> Final improvements.
