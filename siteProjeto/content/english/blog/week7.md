On April 3rd, we had a meeting with our coordinator LuÃ­s Caldas de Oliveira and our assistant Rafael Cordeiro to discuss our first pitch deck.
Several shortcomigs were identified, including:
* esthetic issues;
* lack of presentation of results;
* lack of schematics of our current and future solutions
* lack of description current and future challenges

A further discussion was had regarding localization technologies.
Mentioned technologies:
* GPS -> more adequate in outdoor solutions;
* BLE Beacons -> cheap, but require multiple devices and previous placement;
* Ultra Wide Band -> allows for less devices, but very expensive;
* Extende Kalman Filters -> relevant for tracking moving targets;
* Wi-Fi -> very low accuracy.
